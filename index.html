                    <p><b>Abstract: </b> The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for governments and healthcare systems worldwide, highlighting the critical importance of understanding the factors that contribute to virus transmission. This study aimed to identify the most influential age groups in COVID-19 infection rates at the US county level using the Modified Morris Method and deep learning for time-series. Our approach involved training the state-of-the-art time-series model Temporal Fusion Transformer on different age groups as a static feature and the population vaccination status as the dynamic feature. We analyzed the impact of those age groups on COVID-19 infection rates by perturbing individual input features and ranked them based on their Morris sensitivity scores, which quantify their contribution to COVID-19 transmission rates. The findings are verified using ground truth data from the CDC and US Census, which provide the true infection rates for each age group. The results suggest that young adults were the most influential age group in COVID-19 transmission at the county level between March 1, 2020 and November 27, 2021. Using these results can inform public health policies and interventions, such as targeted vaccination strategies, to better control the spread of the virus. Our approach demonstrates the utility of feature sensitivity analysis in identifying critical factors contributing to COVID-19 transmission and can be applied in other public health domains. </p>

                    <p><b>Abstract: </b> Deep Learning for Time-series plays a key role in
                        AI for healthcare. To predict the progress of infectious disease
                        outbreaks and demonstrate clear population-level impact, more
                        granular analyses are urgently needed that control for important and potentially confounding county-level socioeconomic and
                        health factors. We forecast US county-level COVID-19 infections
                        using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). We focus on
                        heterogeneous time-series deep learning model prediction while
                        interpreting the complex spatiotemporal features learned from
                        the data. The significance of the work is grounded in a real-world
                        COVID-19 infection prediction with highly non-stationary, finely
                        granular, and heterogeneous data. 1) Our model can capture the
                        detailed daily changes of temporal and spatial model behaviors
                        and achieves better prediction performance compared to other
                        time-series models. 2) We analyzed the attention patterns from
                        TFT to interpret the temporal and spatial patterns learned by the
                        model. 3) We collected around 2.5 years of socioeconomic and
                        health features for 3142 US counties, such as observed cases,
                        and a number of static (age distribution and health disparity)
                        and dynamic features (vaccination, disease spread, transmissible
                        cases, and social distancing). Using the proposed framework,
                        we have shown that our model can learn complex interactions.
                        Interpreting different impacts at the county level would be crucial
                        for understanding the infection process that can help effective
                        public health decision-making.</p>
