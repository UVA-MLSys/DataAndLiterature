                                Time series data typically exhibit various temporal patterns, such as trend, seasonal,
                                and cyclic patterns. Here we investigate how well our TFT model can learn and interpret these
                                patterns by conducting experiments on data with these patterns.

                                2. Weekly seasonality due to reporting calculated using auto-correlation at different lag days (k &#x2208 [1,21]).
                                Our analysis shows a clear weekly periodicity, where the correlation peaks at lag day k = 7.
                                This is attributed to weekly reporting style from hospitals, leading to less reported cases on weekends.

                                have reduced staffing and operating hours, leading to fewer tests and reported case. Leading to a drop in attention
                                for those days.
